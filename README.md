In this project I tried to make a website which helps a business to make invoices in few mins after entering the customer's name and items purchased with quantity. You can also give that invoice and transaction an unique name too. Once inserting these all values, you can preview the invoice before saving it finally. Along with this feature, in this project, you can also see all your previous customers list and your product list which is lazy loaded for better ux. I have used fakestoreapi to get all product related data. This project includes the tech like SSR, API Integration, Lazy loading, React slick image carousal, react query, state management using redux, usage of browser storage, materialUI for UIs etc. Hope you like the project.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
